# Boolean Expressions
## Overview
**Conditions** are how programmers can make decisions in programs, by allowing some parts of the code to only run under certain circumstances. Conditions will generally work by evaluating a **boolean expression**, which is an expression that will have a value of either true or false. Programmers can set conditions such that different code will run depending on what the value of the boolean expression is.
